# Awesome NIST [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

A curated list of awesome open-source software repositories from NIST

This list serves to highlight open-source projects from NIST that
demonstrate modern software development practices, improve discoverability
of such software beyond the six pinned (most-forked) repos, and to
publicly acknowledge the developers of such software for their
commitment to high software development standards.

Any repository within the [usnistgov][_usng] organization is eligible.
Candidates for inclusion in this list will be reviewed against a common
set of [criteria](AWESOME.md), and must be approved by at least two
[curators][_crtr].

You are invited to [nominate a repository](CONTRIBUTING.md). Please
consider [what makes a repository awesome](AWESOME.md) first. If you
consider an unlisted workflow model or service integration to be an
indicator of awesomeness, please file an [issue][_issu] and we'll take
a look!
